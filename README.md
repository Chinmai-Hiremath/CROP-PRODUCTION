# CROP-PRODUCTION
This project analyzes India's crop production trends using historical data to assess the impact of climate, soil, and irrigation. The data sources include government and FAO databases, as well as Kaggle datasets. Technologies used for analysis include Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL, Power BI/Tableau, and Excel. Key insights derived from this study focus on state-wise production trends, climate and irrigation influences, and seasonal variations affecting yield efficiency. The project structure comprises datasets, notebooks for analysis, scripts for processing, visualizations, and summary reports. To set up, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run Jupyter Notebook. Users can preprocess data, analyze trends, visualizeâ€¦
